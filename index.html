                <img src="assets/images/EyeOfMadnessSmol.png" alt="black eye with red sclera" width="25%">i am an aspiring software developer with a heart of dreams, mind overflowing with ideas, and a gut full of Dr. Pepper.
                 Most of my ideas include the creation of various types of video games that i would like to have existing,
                 but don't as of the moment due to me not having the skills needed to make it happen.</p>
            <p class="favorites">my favorite story story to have ever witnessed is Homestuck, which is a very complicated and ridiculous webcomic about a
                 group of kids that play a game and bring the apocalypse to the earth. Also my favorite kind of music is Heavy Metal.</p>
